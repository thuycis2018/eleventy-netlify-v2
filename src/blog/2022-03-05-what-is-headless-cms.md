Headless CMS has no built-in front-end or presentation layer. It has a back-end that handle design, templates and site structure. It can then be sent to multiple display types such as web site, devices, and Internet of Things (IoT).

This site is currently using Netlify CMS. Articles can be created and managed in Netlify CMS. When changes occurred, Netlify will push the changes to my GitHub and then that will start the deployment of Eleventy and generate static content pages. These pages will be available instantly on this site.
