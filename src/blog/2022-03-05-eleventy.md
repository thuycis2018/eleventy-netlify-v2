Eleventy is very easy to install in your local machine as long as you have NodeJS installed. Then you can use different markup languages, whichever works best for you to set up the layout and structure of your site. When you run build, Eleventy will transforms directories of templates into HTML. Eleventy works with HTML, Markdown, Liquid, Nunjucks, Handlebars, Mustache, EJS, Haml, Pug, and JavaScript Template Literals.

For  https://julia-le.netlify.app/, I am using Nunjunks and Markdown.
