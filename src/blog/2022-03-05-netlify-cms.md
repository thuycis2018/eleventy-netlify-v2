### Great Speed
Netlify CMS provides an easy way to provide content editors access to contribute quickly and their changes are automatically deployed to live site.



### Well Integrated with GitHub
Content is stored and tracked in GitHub repository. This will allow changes to sync and multiple developers and content editors can work on the project at the same time.
