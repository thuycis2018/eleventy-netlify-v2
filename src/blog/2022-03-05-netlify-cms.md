### Static + content management
Get the speed, security, and scalability of a static site, while still providing a convenient editing interface for content.


### An integrated part of your Git workflow
Content is stored in your Git repository alongside your code for easier versioning, multi-channel publishing, and the option to handle content updates directly in Git.
